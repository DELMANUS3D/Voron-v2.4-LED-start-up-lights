Voron v2.4 startup led macro

This macro was inspired by @JJ Shankles

I am using 95 RGB led as chamber lights and wrote a little long macro because of the amount af led I have.

This macro will only be then printer is switch on. The initial start-up of your printer.

This is purely for ascetic, because why not.
